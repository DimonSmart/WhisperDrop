# IDD Engineering

Engineering Rules are current durable implementation guardrails owned by this project.

Read `INDEX.md` first. Do not load every rule by default. Use the index for discovery, then read only all Always rules and the Conditional rules that are semantically relevant to the current implementation task.

## Boundary

Use `.idd/intent/` for product behavior, externally observable properties, public/domain/compatibility contracts, product-significant operational constraints, and ADR rationale.

Use `.idd/engineering/` for implementation-only durable constraints used to preserve architecture, consistency, maintainability, or engineering conventions.

Ask:

> Could another implementation completely preserve the product contract and still be forbidden by this rule?

If yes, the constraint usually belongs here.

Engineering Rules are not product intent, Factory state, verification commands, task plans, migration progress, or generated descriptions of current code.

ADRs may remain in `.idd/intent/` and explain why an Engineering Rule exists. Rules describe the current normative target state. Git stores history. There is no Engineering archive.

## Discovery and applicability

Applicability is exactly one of:

- `Always`: applies to every implementation change and is mechanically enumerated, not semantically selected.
- `Conditional`: applicability is selected semantically from the human-readable `Applies when` description.

Do not select Conditional rules by filename, keyword, path, extension, glob, project type, embeddings, or similarity score.

## Rule format

Stable IDs use `ENG-NNNN`.

Canonical filenames match:

```text
^ENG-\\d{4}\\.rule-[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*\\.md$
```

The first heading must equal the filename stem.

Canonical structure:

```markdown
# ENG-0001.rule-ui-composition

## Rule

A concise normative rule.

## Applicability

Conditional

## Applies when

- creating or modifying user-visible UI

## Rationale

Why the rule exists.

## Guidance

Practical implementation constraints and allowed approaches.

## Verification

Properties or evidence that should demonstrate conformance.
Do not put build or test commands here.
```

For `Always`, `## Applies when` is optional and does not alter applicability.

Rule documents are normative. `INDEX.md` is only a compact metadata projection for discovery. INDEX Applicability must match the document.

`idd-engineering-change` is the standard workflow for ordinary explicit Rule
add, modify, and remove mutations. `idd-intent-import` may create or update
Rules only while migrating explicit durable Engineering decisions already
present in supplied authoritative import sources; it does not infer policy from
code or perform ordinary removal. One request may produce one or more semantically coherent Rules; the complete batch is planned before files change. `INDEX.md` carries the authoritative `Next ID: ENG-NNNN` allocator once introduced. New canonical layers start at `ENG-0001`; only new Rules consume sequential IDs, while modifications, no-ops, and removals do not consume IDs. A legacy layer without allocator remains readable and receives `max(current IDs) + 1` only immediately before its first real management mutation.

When this directory exists, malformed filenames, duplicate IDs, missing or ambiguous INDEX resolution, heading mismatches, invalid Applicability, missing Conditional `Applies when`, an archive directory, task/progress sections, or fenced shell/build/test commands are blocking structural errors for implementation workflows.

Operational verification commands belong in `.idd/verification.yaml`.
